# Daemons
In general, there are two types of services: internal, the relevant services that are required at system startup, which for example, perform hardware-related tasks, and services that are installed by the user, which usually include all server services. Such services run in the background without any user interactionThese are also called `daemons` and are identified by the letter '`d`' at the end of the program name, for example, `sshd` or `systemd`.

## Systemctl
After installing `OpenSSH` on our VM, we can start the service with the following command.

```bash
Adriano@htb[/htb]$ systemctl start ssh
```

After we have started the service, we can now check if it runs without errors.

```bash
Adriano@htb[/htb]$ systemctl status ssh

```

To add OpenSSH to the SysV script to tell the system to run this service after startup, we can link it with the following command:

```bash
Adriano@htb[/htb]$ systemctl enable ssh

Synchronizing state of ssh.service with SysV service script with /lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install.
Executing: /lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install enable ssh
```

Once we reboot the system, the OpenSSH server will automatically run. We can check this with a tool called `ps`.

```bash
Adriano@htb[/htb]$ ps -aux | grep ssh

root       846  0.0  0.1  72300  5660 ?        Ss   Mai14   0:00 /usr/sbin/sshd -D
```

We can also use `systemctl` to list all services.

```bash
Adriano@htb[/htb]$ systemctl list-units --type=service

```

It is quite possible that the services do not start due to an error. To see the problem, we can use the tool `journalctl` to view the logs.

```bash
Adriano@htb[/htb]$ journalctl -u ssh.service --no-pager

## Kill a Process

A process can be in the following states:

-   Running
-   Waiting (waiting for an event or system resource)
-   Stopped
-   Zombie (stopped but still has an entry in the process table).

Processes can be controlled using `kill`, `pkill`, `pgrep`, and `killall`. To interact with a process, we must send a signal to it. We can view all signals with the following command:

```bash
Adriano@htb[/htb]$ kill -l

 1) SIGHUP       2) SIGINT       3) SIGQUIT      4) SIGILL       5) SIGTRAP
 6) SIGABRT      7) SIGBUS       8) SIGFPE       9) SIGKILL     10) SIGUSR1
11) SIGSEGV     12) SIGUSR2     13) SIGPIPE     14) SIGALRM     15) SIGTERM
16) SIGSTKFLT   17) SIGCHLD     18) SIGCONT     19) SIGSTOP     20) SIGTSTP
21) SIGTTIN     22) SIGTTOU     23) SIGURG      24) SIGXCPU     25) SIGXFSZ
26) SIGVTALRM   27) SIGPROF     28) SIGWINCH    29) SIGIO       30) SIGPWR
31) SIGSYS      34) SIGRTMIN    35) SIGRTMIN+1  36) SIGRTMIN+2  37) SIGRTMIN+3
38) SIGRTMIN+4  39) SIGRTMIN+5  40) SIGRTMIN+6  41) SIGRTMIN+7  42) SIGRTMIN+8
43) SIGRTMIN+9  44) SIGRTMIN+10 45) SIGRTMIN+11 46) SIGRTMIN+12 47) SIGRTMIN+13
48) SIGRTMIN+14 49) SIGRTMIN+15 50) SIGRTMAX-14 51) SIGRTMAX-13 52) SIGRTMAX-12
53) SIGRTMAX-11 54) SIGRTMAX-10 55) SIGRTMAX-9  56) SIGRTMAX-8  57) SIGRTMAX-7
58) SIGRTMAX-6  59) SIGRTMAX-5  60) SIGRTMAX-4  61) SIGRTMAX-3  62) SIGRTMAX-2
63) SIGRTMAX-1  64) SIGRTMAX
```
## Background a Process

Sometimes it will be necessary to put the scan or process we just started in the background to continue using the current session to interact with the system or start other processes. As we have already seen, we can do this with the shortcut `[Ctrl + Z]`. As mentioned above, we send the `SIGTSTP` signal to the kernel, which suspends the process.

```bash
Adriano@htb[/htb]$ ping -c 10 www.hackthebox.eu

Adriano@htb[/htb]$ vim tmpfile
[Ctrl + Z]
[2]+  Stopped                 vim tmpfile
```

Now all background processes can be displayed with the following command.

```bash
Adriano@htb[/htb]$ jobs

[1]+  Stopped                 ping -c 10 www.hackthebox.eu
[2]+  Stopped                 vim tmpfile
```

The `[Ctrl] + Z` shortcut suspends the processes, and they will not be executed further. To keep it running in the background, we have to enter the command `bg` to put the process in the background.

```bash
Adriano@htb[/htb]$ bg

Adriano@htb[/htb]$ 
--- www.hackthebox.eu ping statistics ---
10 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 113482ms

[ENTER]
[1]+  Exit 1                  ping -c 10 www.hackthebox.eu
```

Another option is to automatically set the process with an AND sign (`&`) at the end of the command.

```bash
Adriano@htb[/htb]$ ping -c 10 www.hackthebox.eu &

[1] 10825
PING www.hackthebox.eu (172.67.1.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
```

Once the process finishes, we will see the results.

```bash
Adriano@htb[/htb]$ 

--- www.hackthebox.eu ping statistics ---
10 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 9210ms

[ENTER]
[1]+  Exit 1                  ping -c 10 www.hackthebox.eu
```

---

## Foreground a Process

After that, we can use the `jobs` command to list all background processes. Backgrounded processes do not require user interaction, and we can use the same shell session without waiting until the process finishes first. Once the scan or process finishes its work, we will get notified by the terminal that the process is finished.

```bash
Adriano@htb[/htb]$ jobs

[1]+  Running                 ping -c 10 www.hackthebox.eu &
```

If we want to get the background process into the foreground and interact with it again, we can use the `fg <ID>` command.

```bash
Adriano@htb[/htb]$ fg 1
ping -c 10 www.hackthebox.eu

--- www.hackthebox.eu ping statistics ---
10 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 9206ms
```
## Execute Multiple Commands

There are three possibilities to run several commands, one after the other. These are separated by:

-   Semicolon (`;`)
-   Double `ampersand` characters (`&&`)
-   Pipes (`|`)

The difference between them lies in the previous processes' treatment and depends on whether the previous process was completed successfully or with errors. The semicolon (`;`) is a command separator and executes the commands by ignoring previous commands' results and errors.

```bash
Adriano@htb[/htb]$ echo '1'; echo '2'; echo '3'

1
2
3
```
