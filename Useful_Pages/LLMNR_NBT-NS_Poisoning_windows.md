# LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning - from Windows

## [Inveigh](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh)

If we end up with a Windows host as our attack box, our client provides us with a Windows box to test from, or we land on a Windows host as a local admin via another attack method and would like to look to further our access, the tool Inveigh works similar to Responder, but is written in PowerShell and C#. Inveigh can listen to IPv4 and IPv6 and several other protocols, including **LLMNR**, DNS, **mDNS**, NBNS, **DHCPv6**, ICMPv6, **HTTP**, HTTPS, **SMB**, LDAP, **WebDAV**, and Proxy Auth.
