# RDP PTH(Pass-the-hash)

We may want to access applications or software installed on a user's Windows system that is only available with GUI access during a penetration test. If we have plaintext credentials for the target user, it will be no problem to RDP into the system. However, what if we only have the NT hash of the user obtained from a credential dumping attack such as SAM database, and we could not crack the hash to reveal the plaintext password? In some instances, we can perform an RDP PtH attack to gain GUI access to the target system using tools like xfreerdp.

There are a few caveats to this attack:
Restricted Admin Mode, which is disabled by default, should be enabled on the target host; otherwise, we will be prompted with the following error:
```cmd
reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa /t REG_DWORD /v DisableRestrictedAdmin /d 0x0 /f
```

Once the registry key is added, we can use xfreerdp with the option /pth to gain RDP access:

```bash
Attacker@xxx[/xxx]# xfreerdp /v:192.168.220.152 /u:lewen /pth:300FF5E89EF33F83A8146C10F5AB9BB9

Keep in mind that this will not work against every Windows system we encounter, but it is always worth trying in a situation where we have an NTLM hash, know the user has RDP rights against a machine or set of machines, and GUI access would benefit us in some ways towards fulfilling the goal of our assessment.
