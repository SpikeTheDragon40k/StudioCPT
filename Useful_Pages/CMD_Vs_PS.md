# CMD VS PS

## Use CMD when:

1. You are on an older host that may not include PowerShell.
1. When you only require simple interactions/access to the host.
1. When you plan to use simple batch files, net commands, or MS-DOS native tools.
1. When you believe that execution policies may affect your ability to run scripts or other actions on the host.

## Use PowerShell when:

1. You are planning to utilize cmdlets or other custom-built scripts.
1. When you wish to interact with .NET objects instead of text output.
1. When being stealthy is of lesser concern.
1. If you are planning to interact with cloud-based services and hosts.
1. If your scripts set and use Aliases.
